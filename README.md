# not-reddit - Next.js 13 App

This is the refactored code of an earlier Movie Finder project. This version utilizes the useContext hook for state management rather than Redux Toolkit. 

This application utilises The Movie Database API allowing users to view information about their favourite movies. It gives them the ability to view the most popular, top rated, and upcoming movies as well as the trending movie of the week. Users are able to view each movies cast as well as information on each cast member. Users also have the ability to add movies to their watchlist to keep track of movies they wish to watch and track the movies they have already seen.

This project was produced using React and the context API. The application made use of useContext, useReducer, useEffect, and useState hooks. Local Storage was also utilised to allow users to save movies to the watchlist component.

React Router v6 was used for routing.

Bootstrap was used for styling.

FontAwesome was used for icons.
